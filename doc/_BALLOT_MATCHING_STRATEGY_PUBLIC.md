# Ballot Matching Strategy

**Strategic Question:** How do we identify which upcoming races match our historical flippable patterns?

---

## The Core Concept

Every election cycle, we face new ballots with different contests. But **historical data tells us which types of races are winnable** and in which precincts. By systematically matching upcoming ballot contests to our historical flippable race patterns, we can:

1. **Focus candidate recruitment** on the most winnable races
2. **Allocate resources efficiently** to proven opportunities
3. **Build targeted voter lists** based on past DVA patterns
4. **Predict which contests** will be most responsive to our strategies

### What's Included in Our Flippable Data

Our flippable race database includes **both partisan and municipal races**:

**Partisan Races:**
- Statewide offices (Governor, Attorney General, etc.)
- State legislature (NC House & Senate)
- Federal races (US House & Senate)

**Municipal Races:**
- City/Town Mayors and Council Members
- County Board of Commissioners
- Other local offices

**Why Municipal Races Matter:**
- Often the most winnable (lower information, less partisan)
- Build bench strength for future state races
- Direct impact on local communities
- Same voter activation strategies apply

## The Matching Process

### Step 1: Know What's on the Ballot

Before we can match anything, we need to know what races voters will see:
- What elections are coming up? (Municipal, Primary, General)
- What specific contests are on the ballot? (Mayor, Commissioner, School Board, etc.)
- Which precincts/districts will vote on each race?

### Step 2: Match Contest Types to History

Look at our historical flippable race data and ask:
- Have we seen **this type of race** flip or nearly flip before?
- What were the **vote gaps** in those races?
- How much **DVA activation** was needed?
- Which **precincts** showed the most promise?

### Step 3: Identify Geographic Overlap

Not all precincts are equal. Some have proven track records:
- Which precincts had **multiple flippable races** historically?
- Are those same precincts voting in the upcoming election?
- What was the **DVA voter pool** in those precincts?

## Candidate Recruitment Strategy

### The Right Race in the Right Place

**Question:** Where should we recruit Democratic candidates?

**Answer:** Match candidate recruitment to proven patterns:

1. **Ultra-Competitive + Low DVA** = RECRUIT IMMEDIATELY
   - Historical vote gaps under 3%
   - DVA needed under 12%

2. **Highly Competitive + Moderate DVA** = HIGH PRIORITY
   - Historical vote gaps 3-5%
   - DVA needed 12-20%

3. **Competitive + Higher DVA** = STRONG CANDIDATE NEEDED
   - Historical vote gaps 5-8%
   - DVA needed 20-30%
   - Requires both candidate quality AND field operation

### Recruiting Candidates Who've Run Before

**Special Opportunity: The Rematch Advantage**

Some of the best candidates are those who've already run—and nearly won. Our historical flippable race data now tracks **candidate names**, which opens a powerful recruitment strategy:

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Built-In Motivation**
   - They've tasted defeat by narrow vote gaps
   - They KNOW they can win with just a little more support
   - Our ballot matching data shows them exactly what's needed

2. **Proven Track Record**
   - They've already built a donor base
   - Voters know their name
   - They understand the contest type
   - Infrastructure exists from previous races

3. **Strategic Repositioning**
   - Lost for School Board in District A? Run for Commissioner in overlapping district
   - Lost for Clerk in 2020? Run for School Board in 2026 (easier race type)
   - Lost countywide? Focus on precinct-specific race where they performed best

**How to Use Candidate Name Data:**

1. **Query Historical Candidates:**
   - Pull all flippable races from 2020-2024
   - Identify Democratic candidates who lost narrowly (≤5%)
   - Check if they've run multiple times (improving margins)
   - Look for name matches across different contests

2. **Build "Almost Winners" Database:**
   - Track candidates with ≤3% vote gaps
   - Note which race types they've run for
   - Map their geographic strength (which precincts)
   - Calculate improvement trajectory if they've run multiple times

3. **Recruitment Pitch:**
   - "You lost by X votes. Our data shows that race was flippable."
   - "With Y% DVA activation, you would have won. We can deliver that."
   - "Here's the exact number of voters we need to reach: Z"
   - "We've identified the specific precincts where you performed best"

4. **Strategic Redeployment:**
   - Lost for one office? Find a better match based on data
   - Strong in certain precincts? Target precinct-specific races
   - Improving margins over time? Time to win is NOW

### Tracking Republican Candidate Movement

**The Opposition Research Advantage**

Just as we track our own candidates, tracking **Republican candidate movement** across flippable races reveals critical strategic intelligence:

**Why Track Republican Candidates:**

1. **Vulnerability Patterns**
   - If a Republican won by only 2% in one race, they're vulnerable
   - If they move to a different race, they might be EASIER to beat
   - "Winning ugly" in the past = weakness to exploit

2. **Strategic Overreach**
   - Republican moves from County Commissioner → State Representative
   - Their old seat is now OPEN and historically flippable
   - We know exactly what it takes to flip that seat

3. **Name Recognition Can Cut Both Ways**
   - Candidate who barely won School Board → Runs for Commissioner
   - Voters remember their controversial votes or scandals
   - Their baggage follows them to new race

4. **Resource Allocation Intelligence**
   - If strong Republican moves to different district, their old district weakens
   - We can redeploy resources to the newly vulnerable seat
   - Track GOP talent drain from winnable races

**How to Use Republican Candidate Tracking:**

1. **Identify Vulnerable Winners** - Query flippable races where Republican won by ≤3%
2. **Map Career Trajectories** - Track if margins are improving or declining over time
3. **Find Open Seat Opportunities** - When vulnerable Republican leaves for higher office
4. **Opposition Research Shortcuts** - Know their weaknesses by precinct from past races

## Voter Mobilization Targeting

### Building the Right Voter Universe

**Question:** Who do we contact for each race?

**Answer:** Use historical DVA patterns to build precise lists:

1. **Identify DVA Voters in Target Precincts**
   - Voters who voted for governor but skipped down-ballot races
   - Currently registered Democrats in historically flippable precincts
   - Focus on the specific geography where that race type flipped before

2. **Match Voters to Specific Contests**
   - School Board race? → Contact voters who skipped education races before
   - Judicial race? → Contact voters who skipped judge races before
   - Commissioner race? → Contact voters who skipped local races before

3. **Calculate Activation Targets**
   - If historical data shows 12% DVA activation needed
   - And we have 1,000 DVA voters in target precincts
   - We need to activate 120 voters to flip the race
   - That's 120 conversations, 120 doors, 120 texts

## The Decision Framework

### For Every Upcoming Election

**Step 1: List the Ballot**
- What races are voters deciding?

**Step 2: Check Historical Matches**
- Have these race types been flippable before?
- Where? (Which precincts?)
- How? (DVA or vote gap pathway?)

**Step 3: Score Opportunities**
- High Priority: Contest type + precinct both show historical flippability
- Medium Priority: One strong match (either contest type OR precinct)
- Low Priority: No historical precedent (new race type or new geography)

**Step 4: Allocate Resources**
- **Recruitment:** Focus on high-priority matches first
- **Field Operations:** Invest heavily in historically proven precincts
- **Messaging:** Tailor to contest type (DVA vs. persuasion)
- **Timeline:** Early recruitment for multi-cycle build races

**Step 5: Execute with Precision**
- Build voter lists from historical DVA patterns
- Target specific precincts, not entire county
- Use proven activation percentages as goals
- Measure results to refine future matching

## Why This Matters

### From Reactive to Proactive

**Old Approach:**
- Wait for candidates to emerge
- Scramble for resources across all races
- Hope for the best, guess at targeting
- Spread resources thin

**New Approach:**
- **Predict** which races are winnable BEFORE candidate filing
- **Recruit strategically** for proven opportunities
- **Target precisely** using historical data
- **Concentrate resources** where data shows highest ROI

### The Multiplier Effect

When you match ballot to historical patterns:
1. **Better Candidates** - Recruitment pitch: "Data shows we can win this"
2. **Smarter Targeting** - Don't waste effort on unwinnable races
3. **Efficient Resources** - 10:1 coverage ratio means less money needed
4. **Measurable Goals** - "Activate 12% DVA" is concrete and achievable
5. **Continuous Improvement** - Each cycle refines the matching algorithm

---

## Key Principles

### 1. **History Predicts Future Opportunity**
If a race type flipped (or nearly flipped) in 2020-2024, it can flip in 2026-2028. Demographics change slowly; voter behavior patterns persist.

### 2. **Geography Is Destiny**
Precincts with multiple flippable races aren't random. They have structural characteristics (demographics, political culture, registration trends) that make them competitive. Invest there.

### 3. **Not All Races Are Equal**
Some contest types (judicial, school board) are intrinsically more flippable due to high DVA. Others (partisan executive races) require different strategies. Match strategy to race type.

### 4. **Data Drives Decisions**
Use matching criteria systematically, not intuitively. The precinct you "feel good about" might have zero historical flippability. Trust the data.

### 5. **Build for Multi-Cycle Success**
Matching isn't just for the next election. Build infrastructure in historically flippable precincts NOW, reap rewards across multiple cycles.

## The Bottom Line

**Every election has hundreds of races. We can't win them all. But we don't need to.**

By matching upcoming ballots to historical flippable patterns, we:
- **Know where to fight** (proven precincts)
- **Know what to fight for** (proven race types)
- **Know who to mobilize** (proven DVA voters)
- **Know our odds** (proven activation rates)

This isn't guesswork. It's **strategic precision powered by historical data.**

The flippable races of 2020-2024 are the roadmap to victories in 2026-2028.

All we have to do is **match the ballot to the pattern** and execute.
