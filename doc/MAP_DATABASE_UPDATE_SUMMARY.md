# Map Database Integration Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Map Model (`models.py`)
- Created new `Map` class that connects to existing `maps` table in PostgreSQL database
- Added helper methods:
  - `get_map_for_user(user)` - Get map based on user's state, county, precinct
  - `get_map_by_location(state, county, precinct)` - Get map by specific location

### 2. Updated Main Application (`main.py`)
- Added import for `Map` model
- Created helper functions:
  - `get_map_content_for_user(user)` - Get map content from database for specific user
  - `get_map_content_by_filename(filename)` - Get map content by filename (database first, then static files)
  - `get_static_html_content(filename)` - Fallback to static HTML files
  - `user_can_access_map(user, filename_or_precinct)` - Enhanced access control

### 3. Updated Routes to Use Database
All map-related routes now check database first, then fall back to static files:

- **`/static-content`** - Lists maps from database (filtered by user permissions) + static files
- **`/static-content/<filename>`** - Views maps from database or static files
- **`/static-content-raw/<filename>`** - Serves raw map content from database or static files
- **`/user-map/<filename>`** - User's assigned map from database or static files
- **`/user-map-raw/<filename>`** - Raw user map content with zoom controls
- **`/view/<filename>`** - New tab view with close button
- **`/my-map`** *(NEW)* - Shows current user's map based on their location data
- **`/my-map-raw`** *(NEW)* - Raw content for current user's map

### 4. Database Structure
- **Users table**: Now has `state`, `county`, `is_county` columns populated with 'NC' and 'FORSYTH'
- **Maps table**: Contains 112 maps for NC/FORSYTH precincts with HTML content/filenames

## Database Data Verification
- ✅ Users table has state='NC', county='FORSYTH' for all users
- ✅ Maps table has 112 entries for NC FORSYTH precincts
- ✅ Map lookup works: Found map for precinct 704 (user 'bren')

## Testing Needed

### 1. Application Restart
The Flask application should be restarted to ensure all changes take effect:
```bash
cd /home/bren/Home/Projects/HTML_CSS/precinct
# Kill existing processes if running
pkill -f "python.*main.py"
# Start new instance
/home/bren/Home/Projects/HTML_CSS/precinct/.venv/bin/python main.py
```

### 2. Test Map Access Routes
Test these URLs after restart:
- `/my-map` - Should show user's precinct map based on database location
- `/static-content` - Should list maps from database
- `/user-map/704.html` - Should show precinct 704 map for user 'bren'

### 3. User Experience
- **Regular users**: Can access their precinct map via `/my-map`
- **County users**: Can browse all maps in their county via `/static-content`
- **Admin users**: Can access all maps

## Benefits of This Update

1. **Centralized Data**: Maps stored in database instead of scattered static files
2. **Dynamic Access**: Maps are served based on user's actual location data (state/county/precinct)
3. **Better Security**: Access control based on user permissions and location
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new precincts and maps to database
5. **Fallback Support**: Still supports static HTML files if database doesn't have content

## Future Enhancements

1. **Map Upload Interface**: Admin interface to upload/edit maps in database
2. **Map Versioning**: Track changes to maps over time
3. **Map Metadata**: Additional fields like description, last updated, etc.
4. **Bulk Import**: Tools to import existing static HTML files into database

## Files Modified
- `models.py` - Added Map model
- `main.py` - Updated all map-related routes and added helper functions

## Database Tables Used
- `users` - User location data (state, county, precinct)
- `maps` - Map content/filenames by location
