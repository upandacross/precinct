# DVA vs Vote Gap Metric Analysis

**Date:** October 21, 2025  

## 🤔 The  Question

**Which metric is better for identifying flippable races: DVA percentage needed or raw vote gap?**

## Definition of terms

- **DVA: Democratic Voter Absenteism: Democtatic voters who voted for governor but didn't vote in subject race**
- **Vote Gap: difference between Democratic vote and highest vote of any non-Democratic candidate**

## 📊 Analysis Results Summary

### Key Findings
- **Total races analyzed:** 481 Republican-won races evaluated for "Flippability"
- **DVA pathway preferred:** 322 races (66.9%)
- **Traditional pathway preferred:** 159 races (33.1%)
- **Pathway agreement rate:** Only 11.2% (they disagree 88.8% of the time!)

### Resource Efficiency
- **DVA Pathway:** 11.2% activation of 426,170 down-ballot absent Democrats
- **Traditional Pathway:** 14,961 new votes needed across 159 flippable races

## 🎯 CONCLUSION: DVA is Superior

**Why DVA wins as the primary metric:**

1. **🔢 More Targets:** Identifies 366 vs 219 "achievable" races
2. **⚡ Resource Efficient:** Leverages existing Democratic voters
3. **📈 Strategic Framework:** Better for voter mobilization campaigns
4. **💪 Realistic:** Works with voter absenteeism rather than against it

## 🏆 Top Targets by Each Metric

### Top 5 by DVA (More Strategic)
1. FORSYTH P132 - **0.1% DVA** (2 vote gap)
2. FORSYTH P803 - **0.2% DVA** (2 vote gap)  
3. FORSYTH P16 - **0.2% DVA** (3 vote gap)
4. FORSYTH P809 - **0.2% DVA** (4 vote gap)
5. FORSYTH P71 - **0.2% DVA** (4 vote gap)

### Top 5 by Vote Gap (More Tactical)
1. FORSYTH P132 - **2 votes** (0.1% DVA)
2. FORSYTH P803 - **2 votes** (0.2% DVA)
3. FORSYTH P16 - **3 votes** (0.2% DVA)
4. FORSYTH P52 - **3 votes** (0.5% DVA)
5. FORSYTH P62 - **3 votes** (999.9% DVA) 

## 💡 Strategic Implications

### Use DVA as Primary Metric Because:
- **Scalable:** Can mobilize thousands of absent Democrats voters who are already in the voting booth
- **Sustainable:** Builds lasting voter engagement
- **Efficient:** Lower percentage activation needed
- **Strategic:** Addresses root cause (Democratic absenteeism)

### Use Vote Gap as Secondary Metric For:
- **Immediate wins:** Races needing <10 votes
- **Resource planning:** Concrete vote targets
- **Campaign messaging:** Easy to understand numbers
- **Traditional outreach:** New voter registration

## 🚀 Recommendation

**Use DVA as the primary strategic metric with vote gap as tactical support:**

1. **Strategic Planning:** Prioritize by DVA percentage
2. **Resource Allocation:** Focus on ≤25% DVA races first
3. **Campaign Design:** Build voter mobilization around absenteeism
4. **Tactical Execution:** Use vote gap for specific race targeting

**Bottom Line:** DVA methodology is superior because it works WITH existing Democratic voters rather than trying to find entirely new ones. In a resource-constrained environment, activating absent Democrats is more efficient than converting or registering new voters.
