# Static HTML Display Fix

## Problem
Static HTML files with complex content (JavaScript, CSS, maps, etc.) were not displaying properly in the Flask app but worked fine in Firefox when opened directly.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used `{{ content | safe }}` to embed HTML content directly into the Flask template. This caused conflicts because:

1. **CSS Conflicts**: Styles from the static HTML conflicted with the app's Bootstrap styles
2. **JavaScript Issues**: Scripts couldn't execute properly in the embedded context
3. **Map Rendering**: Leaflet maps and other interactive content failed to initialize
4. **DOCTYPE Conflicts**: Multiple HTML documents caused parsing issues

## Solution
Implemented iframe-based content display with two new routes:

### New Routes Added:
1. **`/static-content/<filename>`** - Main viewer page with navigation
2. **`/static-content-raw/<filename>`** - Serves raw HTML for iframe embedding

### Technical Changes:

**main.py:**
- Added `view_static_content_raw()` route to serve raw HTML content
- Modified `view_static_content()` to use iframe approach
- Removed direct content reading from viewer route

**static_viewer.html:**
- Replaced direct HTML embedding with iframe
- Added "Open in New Tab" button for better viewing
- Updated fullscreen functionality for iframe content
- Enhanced print functionality to work with iframes
- Added iframe load event handling

### Benefits:
- **Complete Isolation**: HTML content runs in its own context
- **Full JavaScript Support**: Maps, interactive elements work properly
- **CSS Independence**: No style conflicts with main app
- **Security**: Content sandboxed in iframe
- **Fallback Options**: Links to open content in new tabs

### Features Added:
- **New Tab Opening**: Direct access to raw HTML content
- **Iframe Printing**: Smart print functionality
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Enhanced for iframe content
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for loading issues
- **Progress Indication**: Load event monitoring

## File Types Supported
All HTML files with any complexity level:
- Simple HTML documents
- Interactive maps (Leaflet, Google Maps)
- JavaScript applications
- CSS-heavy layouts
- Bootstrap components
- Custom styling and scripts

## Usage
1. Place HTML files in `static_html/` directory
2. Access via "Static Content" in navigation
3. Click "View" to see content in iframe
4. Use "Open in New Tab" for full-window viewing
5. Print and fullscreen options available

This fix ensures that all static HTML content displays correctly within the Flask app while maintaining the integrated navigation and quick action functionality.
