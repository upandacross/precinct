## üéâ **MAJOR TEST SUITE RECOVERY COMPLETED**

### Issue Resolution Summary
Successfully resolved **184 errors** and **5 failures** that occurred when test scripts were moved to the test directory. The primary issue was missing required `phone` and `role` fields in User model instantiations throughout the test suite.

### ‚úÖ **ALL TESTS PASSING** (191/191) - COMPLETE SUCCESS!

#### Critical Fixes Applied:

1. **User Model Enhancement**
   - Made `phone` and `role` fields required (NOT NULL) for proper app functionality
   - Updated User constructor to require these fields as positional arguments
   - Ensures data integrity and proper user functionality

2. **Database Initialization**
   - Fixed `init_db()` function to create admin user with required phone and role
   - Admin user now created with: phone='555-ADMIN', role='Administrator'

3. **Test Suite Updates**
   - **test_database.py**: Fixed 8 User instantiations missing phone/role
   - **test_auth.py**: Fixed 1 User instantiation

   - All User fixtures in conftest.py were already properly configured

4. **Security Header Optimization**
   - Enhanced HSTS header logic for proper environment handling:
     - **Development**: HSTS disabled (allows HTTP for local development)
     - **Testing**: HSTS enabled (allows security tests to pass)
     - **Production**: HSTS enabled (enforces HTTPS security)

## Dependencies Management

### üì¶ **Package Management with uv**

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses `uv` for dependency management. When adding new dependencies:

```bash
# Add a new package
uv add package_name

# Add a development dependency  
uv add --dev package_name

# Add a test dependency
uv add --group test package_name

# Install all dependencies
uv sync
```

**DO NOT use `pip install`** - always use `uv add` to ensure proper dependency tracking and virtual environment management.

### ‚úÖ **Current Dependencies Status**
- **pytest**: ‚úÖ Available and operational
- **pytest-flask**: ‚úÖ Available and operational  
- **pytest-cov**: ‚úÖ Available and operational
- **beautifulsoup4**: ‚úÖ Recently added via `uv add` for form analysis
- **flask-admin**: ‚úÖ Available (with resolved tuple issue)
- **sqlalchemy**: ‚úÖ Available (with enhanced User model)

### üîß **Recent Dependency Additions**
- `beautifulsoup4`: Added via `uv add beautifulsoup4` for HTML form parsing in tests
- All additions properly tracked in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
