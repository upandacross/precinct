# Candidate Recruitment Reports

This directory contains personalized candidate recruitment reports generated by `app_administration/generate_candidate_report.py`.

Reports are generated per candidate and include:
- Historical flippability data for their target race
- DVA needed and voter activation targets  
- Past performance (if they've run before)
- Recruitment talking points and strategy

**Note:** Individual reports (`.md` files) are gitignored for privacy. Only this README is tracked.
