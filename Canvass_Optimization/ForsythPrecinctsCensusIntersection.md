## üìä Analysis Overview

### Objective
Perform spatial analysis to understand how voting precincts align with Census tract boundaries in Forsyth County, NC, enabling demographic-based canvass optimization and voter outreach strategy development.

### Key Questions Addressed
1. **Spatial Relationships**: Which precincts intersect with which census tracts?
2. **Overlap Analysis**: What percentage of each precinct falls within each census tract?
3. **Demographic Mapping**: How can census demographic data be attributed to precincts?
4. **Buffer Analysis**: What areas within walking distance of precinct boundaries cross tract lines?

**Key Insights:**
1. **Multi-Tract Precinct**: Precinct 704 spans three census tracts
2. **Primary Tract**: Tract 11 contains the majority (51.2%) of the precinct
3. **Demographic Attribution**: Use weighted average based on overlap percentages
4. **Buffer Analysis**: 50m buffer extends into adjacent tracts, affecting canvass routes

### Buffer Zone Analysis

```sql
-- 50-meter buffer analysis for canvass optimization
WITH precinct_buffers AS (
    SELECT 
        precinct_id,
        precinct_name,
        ST_Buffer(geom, 50) as buffer_geom,  -- 50-meter buffer
        ST_Area(ST_Buffer(geom, 50)) - ST_Area(geom) as buffer_area
    FROM voting_precincts 
    WHERE precinct_id = '704'
),
buffer_tract_intersections AS (
    SELECT 
        pb.precinct_id,
        pb.precinct_name,
        ct.tractce,
        ct.namelsad,
        ST_Area(ST_Intersection(pb.buffer_geom, ct.geom)) as buffer_intersection_area,
        ROUND((ST_Area(ST_Intersection(pb.buffer_geom, ct.geom)) / pb.buffer_area) * 100, 2) as buffer_pct
    FROM precinct_buffers pb
    JOIN census_tracts ct ON ST_Intersects(pb.buffer_geom, ct.geom)
    WHERE ct.statefp = '37' AND ct.countyfp = '067'
)
SELECT * FROM buffer_tract_intersections 
ORDER BY buffer_intersection_area DESC;
```

## üéØ Demographic Attribution Methodology

### Weighted Demographic Calculation

When a precinct spans multiple census tracts, demographic data is attributed using area-weighted averages:

```python
def calculate_weighted_demographics(precinct_id, intersection_data, demographic_data):
    """
    Calculate area-weighted demographic statistics for a precinct
    that spans multiple census tracts.
    """
    total_area = sum(intersection['intersection_area'] for intersection in intersection_data)
    weighted_values = {}
    
    for variable in demographic_data.columns:
        weighted_sum = 0
        total_weight = 0
        
        for intersection in intersection_data:
            tract_geoid = intersection['full_geoid']
            area_weight = intersection['intersection_area'] / total_area
            
            if tract_geoid in demographic_data.index:
                tract_value = demographic_data.loc[tract_geoid, variable]
                if tract_value is not None:
                    weighted_sum += tract_value * area_weight
                    total_weight += area_weight
        
        weighted_values[variable] = weighted_sum / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else None
    
    return weighted_values

# Example usage for Precinct 704
precinct_704_demographics = calculate_weighted_demographics(
    precinct_id='704',
    intersection_data=precinct_704_intersections,
    demographic_data=census_acs_data
)
```

### Attribution Rules

1. **Primary Attribution** (>50% overlap): Use tract demographics directly
2. **Weighted Attribution** (Multiple tracts): Use area-weighted average
3. **Minimum Threshold**: Ignore intersections <1% of precinct area
4. **Missing Data Handling**: Use county-level averages for missing tract data

## üìä Canvass Optimization Applications

### Priority Area Identification

**High-Priority Canvassing Areas:**
1. **Dense Intersections**: Areas where multiple precincts meet census tracts
2. **Demographic Transitions**: Boundaries between different income/age tract areas  
3. **Buffer Zones**: 50-meter walking areas that cross tract boundaries
4. **Mixed-Use Areas**: High housing density with diverse demographics

### Canvass Route Optimization

```sql
-- Generate optimal canvass routes considering tract boundaries
WITH canvass_zones AS (
    SELECT 
        precinct_id,
        tract_id,
        ST_Centroid(intersection_geom) as zone_center,
        intersection_area,
        precinct_overlap_pct,
        -- Estimate housing units in intersection
        ROUND(intersection_area / 1000) as estimated_households  -- Rough estimate
    FROM intersection_analysis
    WHERE precinct_overlap_pct > 5  -- Focus on significant areas
),
route_network AS (
    SELECT 
        cz.*,
        -- Calculate distances between zone centers
        ST_Distance(cz.zone_center, cz2.zone_center) as distance_to_next,
        cz2.precinct_id as next_precinct,
        cz2.tract_id as next_tract
    FROM canvass_zones cz
    CROSS JOIN canvass_zones cz2
    WHERE cz.precinct_id != cz2.precinct_id
    AND ST_Distance(cz.zone_center, cz2.zone_center) < 500  -- Within 500m
)
SELECT * FROM route_network 
ORDER BY precinct_id, distance_to_next;
```

### Demographic-Based Targeting

**Voter Outreach Strategy by Tract Characteristics:**

| Tract Profile | Canvass Approach | Optimal Times | Key Messages |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| High-Income, Owner-Occupied | Door-to-door, scheduled | Weekends, Evenings | Policy details, endorsements |
| High-Rental, Young Adults | Digital + door-to-door | Afternoons, Weekends | Registration, accessibility |
| Mixed Demographics | Community events | Varied schedule | Broad appeal, local issues |
| Senior-Heavy Areas | Personal outreach | Mid-morning, Early evening | Healthcare, services |

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations

**Spatial Index Creation:**
```sql
-- Create essential spatial indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_voting_precincts_geom ON voting_precincts USING GIST (geom);
CREATE INDEX idx_census_tracts_geom ON census_tracts USING GIST (geom);
CREATE INDEX idx_precincts_county ON voting_precincts (county_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_tracts_state_county ON census_tracts (statefp, countyfp);

-- Composite index for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tracts_geoid_geom ON census_tracts (geoid) INCLUDE (geom);
```

**Query Optimization:**
- Use `ST_Intersects()` before `ST_Intersection()` to filter candidates
- Create bounding box filters with `&&` operator for initial screening
- Use `LIMIT` and pagination for large result sets
- Consider `ST_Simplify()` for visualization queries

### Data Quality Assurance

**Geometry Validation:**
```sql
-- Validate and repair geometries
UPDATE census_tracts 
SET geom = ST_MakeValid(geom) 
WHERE NOT ST_IsValid(geom);

UPDATE voting_precincts 
SET geom = ST_MakeValid(geom) 
WHERE NOT ST_IsValid(geom);

-- Check for topology issues
SELECT 
    tractce,
    ST_IsValid(geom) as is_valid,
    ST_IsValidReason(geom) as validation_message
FROM census_tracts 
WHERE NOT ST_IsValid(geom);
```

**Coordinate System Consistency:**
- All geometries stored in WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
- Area calculations use appropriate projected coordinate system
- Buffer operations account for geographic vs. projected coordinates
